**Some things about me:**

I'm currently a student at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) studying Data Science and Economics.

I was born in San Jose and grew up between the Bay Area and China. This dual upbringing shaped how I think about society, technology, people, and a lot about scale, and pushed me toward studying economics.

While studying, I spent time at hackathons, building passion projects, and doing personal deep dives on my interests, ex. AI/ML, economics, and philosophy.

A summer spent co-founding [mymelo.org](https://mymelo.org) pushed me to realizing what I want to make of my life: using software to create meaningful things for the world at scale.

My personal philosophy is derived from a Derek Sivers essay: **die empty**. Get every idea out of your head and into reality. Calling yourself creative doesn't make it true; only launched creations are real. I view engineering as a way to predict the future by creating it.

**Some things I'm interested in:**

- **Neuroscience.** We are extraordinarily lacking in deep understanding of our brains and the seemingly basic questions—what is intelligence? Perhaps understanding the constraints and architecture of our physical brain is the path leading to replicating general intelligence in synthetic systems.

- **Health and fitness.** Healthy body, healthy mind. Former powerlifter at 96kg, now a calisthenics, running, and general cardio enthusiast. Connect with me on [Strava](https://strava.app.link/sFzLQAHLMZb).

- **Investing.** Believer in people, dreams, and American exceptionalism.

- **Art of all forms.** It is what brings color into an otherwise gray and mechanical world; the ultimate output of human experience. Whether writing code, playing guitar, or designing systems, I believe in shipping work that is authentic rather than perfect.

- **Robotics and embodied AI.** Witnessing modern factories at scale in Shenzhen (and playing Factorio) has made me extremely bullish on building physically intelligent systems with AI, and bearish on standalone chat intelligence. LLMs have given us a glimpse of how effective machines can be in altering the physical world. Drone enthusiast.
