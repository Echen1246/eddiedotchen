A book about writing that practices what it preaches. Every sentence is deliberate.

The core message: most of what you learned about writing is wrong. Forget outlines. Forget topic sentences. Write one sentence at a time. Make each one worth reading on its own.

Klinkenborg attacks the "transition" mindset that treats sentences as bridges to the next idea. Every sentence should be a destination. This changes how you read and write. Short, powerful, and immediately applicable.
