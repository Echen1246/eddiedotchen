A compilation of Naval's wisdom on wealth and happiness. Dense with actionable mental models.

Naval's framing of specific knowledge as something that cannot be taught but must be learned through experience resonated deeply. His emphasis on leverage through code, media, and capital as the modern path to wealth creation is practical and timely.

The happiness section hits different. The idea that happiness is a skill you can develop, not something that happens to you, is liberating. Worth revisiting every few months.
