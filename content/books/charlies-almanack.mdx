The collected wisdom of Charlie Munger. A masterclass in multidisciplinary thinking.

Munger's latticework of mental models approach fundamentally changed how I think about learning. Instead of going deep in one field, he advocates for knowing the big ideas from all major disciplines and applying them in combination.

The speeches are gold. His talk on the psychology of human misjudgment should be required reading for anyone making decisions under uncertainty. Dense, rewarding, and endlessly quotable.
