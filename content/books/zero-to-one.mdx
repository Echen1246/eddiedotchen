Thiel's contrarian framework for building monopolies. Competition is for losers.

The core question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? If you can find one and build a business around it, you can create something new rather than copying what exists.

The monopoly framing is provocative but useful. Don't compete on price in crowded markets. Find or create a small market you can dominate completely, then expand. Definite optimism as a worldview. Short, dense, and full of ideas worth arguing with.
