How to talk to customers without getting lied to. Essential for anyone building products.

The title comes from a simple truth: if you ask your mom whether your business idea is good, she'll say yes. Not because it is, but because she loves you. Most customer conversations are equally useless.

The fix: ask about their life, not your idea. Ask about the past, not hypotheticals. Look for specifics, not generalities. This book will save you from building things nobody wants. Short, practical, immediately applicable.
