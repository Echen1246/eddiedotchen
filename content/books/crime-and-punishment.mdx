Dostoevsky's psychological thriller about guilt, redemption, and the limits of rational morality.

Raskolnikov's theory that extraordinary men are above conventional morality gets systematically dismantled through his own psychological disintegration. The murder itself takes only a few pages; the real story is watching a man's conscience destroy him.

The interrogation scenes with Porfiry are masterful cat-and-mouse games. Dostoevsky understood human psychology at a depth that still feels ahead of its time. One of the greatest novels ever written.
