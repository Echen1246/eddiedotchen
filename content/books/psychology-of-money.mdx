Short, punchy essays on the behavioral side of finance. How we actually make money decisions vs. how we should.

Housel's core insight: doing well with money has little to do with intelligence and a lot to do with behavior. The highest returns come from being consistently not stupid rather than occasionally brilliant.

The chapter on tail events is crucial. Most of what happens doesn't matter. A few outlier moments drive everything. Your job is to stay in the game long enough for the tails to work in your favor.
