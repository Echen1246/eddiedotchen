Grove's framework for navigating strategic inflection points. When the fundamentals of your business change, adapt or die.

Intel's pivot from memory to microprocessors is the central case study. Grove walked out of his office, walked back in, and asked: if the board fired us and brought in new management, what would they do? Then they did that.

The 10x force concept is useful. When something in your environment changes by an order of magnitude, your old strategies stop working. The challenge is recognizing the shift before it's too late.
