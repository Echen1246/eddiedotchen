The epic historical novel of China's Three Kingdoms period. Strategy, loyalty, and the rise and fall of heroes.

Zhuge Liang's strategic genius, Guan Yu's legendary loyalty, Cao Cao's ruthless pragmatism. Each character embodies different approaches to power and virtue. The novel shaped Chinese culture's ideals of heroism and brotherhood.

The strategic thinking displayed is timeless. Empty fort strategies, borrowing arrows, forming alliances against common enemies. A masterclass in maneuvering through chaos.
