Jungian archetypes through the lens of Greek goddesses. A framework for understanding feminine psychology.

Bolen maps seven goddess archetypes to different patterns of behavior and motivation. Athena the strategist, Aphrodite the lover, Artemis the independent. Each represents a different way of being in the world.

Useful as a lens for understanding people, though the framework can feel reductive at times. The real value is in recognizing which archetypes are active in yourself and others, and understanding the shadows each brings.
