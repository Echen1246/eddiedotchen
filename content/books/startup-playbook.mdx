Practical advice from a serial entrepreneur. Less theoretical than most startup books.

Bhargava covers the full lifecycle: ideation, team building, fundraising, scaling, exit. The advice is concrete and experience-based rather than abstract principles.

Most useful for first-time founders who need a checklist of things to consider. More experienced operators might find it basic, but the comprehensiveness is valuable. Good reference book to return to at different stages.
