A manifesto for creative work. Nothing is original; everything is a remix.

Kleon's advice: collect influences obsessively, then combine them in ways only you can. Your unique perspective is the filter that transforms borrowed ideas into original work.

The book itself is a demonstration of its principles. Short, visual, quotable. Good for a quick creative boost, though the ideas are more starting points than deep explorations. Best for people early in their creative journey.
