Kahneman's synthesis of decades of research on human judgment and decision-making.

System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate) provide a framework for understanding when and why we make errors. We're overconfident, we anchor on irrelevant numbers, we confuse frequency with probability.

The depth is remarkable. Every chapter introduces a cognitive bias backed by rigorous experiments. Dense but rewarding. Changed how I think about my own thinking. One of the most important books of the past few decades.
