The story of Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies, the most successful hedge fund in history.

Simons built a team of mathematicians and scientists who treated the market as a code to be cracked. No fundamental analysis, no economic theory. Pure pattern recognition at scale.

The Medallion Fund's returns are almost impossible to believe: 66% annually before fees for decades. The book doesn't fully explain how they do it (they don't tell anyone), but the glimpses are fascinating. A testament to what happens when you apply serious quantitative rigor to markets.
